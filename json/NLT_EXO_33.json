{"verses": ["The Lord said to Moses, “Get going, you and the people you brought up from the land of Egypt. Go up to the land I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

", "Go up to this land that flows with milk and honey. But I will not travel among you, for you are a stubborn and rebellious people. If I did, I would surely destroy you along the way.”", "When the people heard these stern words, they went into mourning and stopped wearing their jewelry and fine clothes. ", "For the Lord had told Moses to tell them, “You are a stubborn and rebellious people. If I were to travel with you for even a moment, I would destroy you. Remove your jewelry and fine clothes while I decide what to do with you.” ", "So from the time they left Mount Sinai, the Israelites wore no more jewelry or fine clothes.", "It was Moses’ practice to take the Tent of Meeting and set it up some distance from the camp.

", "When the people saw the cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, they would stand and bow down in front of their own tents. ", "Inside the Tent of Meeting, the Lord would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Afterward Moses would return to the camp, but the young man who assisted him, Joshua son of Nun, would remain behind in the Tent of Meeting.", "<h>Moses Sees the ’s Glory</h>One day Moses said to the Lord, “You have been telling me, ‘Take these people up to the Promised Land.’ But you haven’t told me whom you will send with me. You have told me, ‘I know you by name, and I look favorably on you.’ ", "If it is true that you look favorably on me, let me know your ways so I may understand you more fully and continue to enjoy your favor. And remember that this nation is your very own people.”", "The Lord replied, “I will personally go with you, Moses, and I will give you rest—everything will be fine for you.”", "Then Moses said, “If you don’t personally go with us, don’t make us leave this place.

", "As my glorious presence passes by, I will hide you in the crevice of the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by. ", "Then I will remove my hand and let you see me from behind. But my face will not be seen.”"]}
