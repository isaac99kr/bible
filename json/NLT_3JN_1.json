I am writing to Gaius, my dear friend, whom I love in the truth.", "Dear friend, I hope all is well with you and that you are as healthy in body as you are strong in spirit.

", "I could have no greater joy than to hear that my children are following the truth.", "<h>Caring for the Lord’s Workers</h>Dear friend, you are being faithful to God when you care for the traveling teachers who pass through, even though they are strangers to you. ", "They have told the church here of your loving friendship. Please continue providing for such teachers in a manner that pleases God. ", "For they are traveling for the Lord, and they accept nothing from people who are not believers. ", "So we ourselves should support them so that we can be their partners as they teach the truth.", "I wrote to the church about this, but Diotrephes, who loves to be the leader, refuses to have anything to do with us.

And when they do help, he puts them out of the church.", "Dear friend, don’t let this bad example influence you. Follow only what is good.
