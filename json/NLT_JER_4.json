You could throw away your detestable idols and stray away no more.", "Then when you swear by my name, saying, ‘As surely as the Lord lives,’ you could do so with truth, justice, and righteousness.

This punishment is bitter, piercing you to the heart!”", "<h>Jeremiah Weeps for His People</h>My heart, my heart—I writhe in pain! My heart pounds within me! I cannot be still.

Suddenly my tents are destroyed; in a moment my shelters are crushed.", "How long must I see the battle flags and hear the trumpets of war?", "“My people are foolish and do not know me,” says the Lord. “They are stupid children who have no understanding.

All the towns have been abandoned— not a person remains!", "What are you doing, you who have been plundered? Why do you dress up in beautiful clothing and put on gold jewelry? Why do you brighten your eyes with mascara? Your primping will do you no good! The allies who were your lovers despise you and seek to kill you.", "I hear a cry, like that of a woman in labor, the groans of a woman giving birth to her first child. It is beautiful Jerusalem gasping for breath and crying out, “Help! I’m being murdered!”"]}
