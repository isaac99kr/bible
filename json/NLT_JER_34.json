{"verses": ["<h>A Warning for Zedekiah</h>King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came with all the armies from the kingdoms he ruled, and he fought against Jerusalem and the towns of Judah.

", "You will not escape his grasp but will be captured and taken to meet the king of Babylon face to face. Then you will be exiled to Babylon.", "“‘But listen to this promise from the Lord, O Zedekiah, king of Judah. This is what the Lord says: You will not be killed in war ", "but will die peacefully. People will burn incense in your memory, just as they did for your ancestors, the kings who preceded you. They will mourn for you, crying, “Alas, our master is dead!” This I have decreed, says the Lord.’”", "So Jeremiah the prophet delivered the message to King Zedekiah of Judah. ", "At this time the Babylonian army was besieging Jerusalem, Lachish, and Azekah—the only fortified cities of Judah not yet captured.", "<h>Freedom for Hebrew Slaves</h>This message came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah made a covenant with the people, proclaiming freedom for the slaves. ", "He had ordered all the people to free their Hebrew slaves—both men and women. No one was to keep a fellow Judean in bondage. ", "The officials and all the people had obeyed the king’s command, ", "but later they changed their minds.
