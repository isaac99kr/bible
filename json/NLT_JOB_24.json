Everything they own is cursed, and they are afraid to enter their own vineyards.", "The grave consumes sinners just as drought and heat consume snow.", "Their own mothers will forget them. Maggots will find them sweet to eat. No one will remember them. Wicked people are broken like a tree in the storm.", "They cheat the woman who has no son to help her.
