", "One day Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, accused Abner of sleeping with one of his father’s concubines, a woman named Rizpah, daughter of Aiah.", "Abner was furious. “Am I some Judean dog to be kicked around like this?” he shouted. “After all I have done for your father, Saul, and his family and friends by not handing you over to David, is this my reward—that you find fault with me about this woman? ", "May God strike me and even kill me if I don’t do everything I can to help David get what the Lord has promised him! ", "I’m going to take Saul’s kingdom and give it to David. I will establish the throne of David over Israel as well as Judah, all the way from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south.” ", "Ishbosheth didn’t dare say another word because he was afraid of what Abner might do.", "Then Abner sent messengers to David, saying, “Doesn’t the entire land belong to you?

", "Palti followed along behind her as far as Bahurim, weeping as he went. Then Abner told him, “Go back home!” So Palti returned.", "Meanwhile, Abner had consulted with the elders of Israel. “For some time now,” he told them, “you have wanted to make David your king.

What do you mean by letting Abner get away?

They found him at the well of Sirah and brought him back, though David knew nothing about it. ", "When Abner arrived back at Hebron, Joab took him aside at the gateway as if to speak with him privately.

Mourn for Abner.” And King David himself walked behind the procession to the grave. ", "They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king and all the people wept at his graveside. ", "Then the king sang this funeral song for Abner: “Should Abner have died as fools die?", "Your hands were not bound; your feet were not chained. No, you were murdered— the victim of a wicked plot.” All the people wept again for Abner. ", "David had refused to eat anything on the day of the funeral, and now everyone begged him to eat. But David had made a vow, saying, “May God strike me and even kill me if I eat anything before sundown.”", "This pleased the people very much. In fact, everything the king did pleased them! ", "So everyone in Judah and all Israel understood that David was not responsible for Abner’s murder.", "Then King David said to his officials, “Don’t you realize that a great commander has fallen today in Israel? ", "And even though I am the anointed king, these two sons of Zeruiah—Joab and Abishai—are too strong for me to control. So may the Lord repay these evil men for their evil deeds.”"]}
