He said, ‘I will give you the sacred blessings I promised to David.’ ", "Another psalm explains it more fully: ‘You will not allow your Holy One to rot in the grave.’ ", "This is not a reference to David, for after David had done the will of God in his own generation, he died and was buried with his ancestors, and his body decayed.
