May these blessings rest on Joseph’s head, crowning the brow of the prince among his brothers.", "Joseph has the majesty of a young bull; he has the horns of a wild ox.

Gad is poised there like a lion to tear off an arm or a head.", "The people of Gad took the best land for themselves; a leader’s share was assigned to them.

Who else is like you, a people saved by the Lord? He is your protecting shield and your triumphant sword! Your enemies will cringe before you, and you will stomp on their backs!”"]}
