", "Finally the craftsmen who were working on the sanctuary left their work. ", "They went to Moses and reported, “The people have given more than enough materials to complete the job the Lord has commanded us to do!”", "So Moses gave the command, and this message was sent throughout the camp: “Men and women, don’t prepare any more gifts for the sanctuary. We have enough!” So the people stopped bringing their sacred offerings. ", "Their contributions were more than enough to complete the whole project.", "<h>Building the Tabernacle</h>The skilled craftsmen made ten curtains of finely woven linen for the Tabernacle. Then Bezalel decorated the curtains with blue, purple, and scarlet thread and with skillfully embroidered cherubim. ", "All ten curtains were exactly the same size—42 feet long and 6 feet wide. ", "Five of these curtains were joined together to make one long curtain, and the other five were joined to make a second long curtain. ", "He made fifty loops of blue yarn and put them along the edge of the last curtain in each set. ", "The fifty loops along the edge of one curtain matched the fifty loops along the edge of the other curtain. ", "Then he made fifty gold clasps and fastened the long curtains together with the clasps.

He decorated it with blue, purple, and scarlet thread and with skillfully embroidered cherubim. ", "For the curtain, he made four posts of acacia wood and four gold hooks.

He made it of finely woven linen and embroidered it with exquisite designs using blue, purple, and scarlet thread. ", "This curtain was hung on gold hooks attached to five posts. The posts with their decorated tops and hooks were overlaid with gold, and the five bases were cast from bronze."]}
