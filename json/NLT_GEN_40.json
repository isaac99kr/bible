", "They remained in prison for quite some time, and the captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, who looked after them.", "While they were in prison, Pharaoh’s cup-bearer and baker each had a dream one night, and each dream had its own meaning. ", "When Joseph saw them the next morning, he noticed that they both looked upset. ", "“Why do you look so worried today?” he asked them.", "And they replied, “We both had dreams last night, but no one can tell us what they mean.” “Interpreting dreams is God’s business,” Joseph replied. “Go ahead and tell me your dreams.”", "So the chief cup-bearer told Joseph his dream first. “In my dream,” he said, “I saw a grapevine in front of me. ", "The vine had three branches that began to bud and blossom, and soon it produced clusters of ripe grapes. ", "I was holding Pharaoh’s wine cup in my hand, so I took a cluster of grapes and squeezed the juice into the cup.

", "Within three days Pharaoh will lift you up and restore you to your position as his chief cup-bearer. ", "And please remember me and do me a favor when things go well for you.

Then birds will come and peck away at your flesh.”", "Pharaoh’s birthday came three days later, and he prepared a banquet for all his officials and staff. He summoned his chief cup-bearer and chief baker to join the other officials. ", "He then restored the chief cup-bearer to his former position, so he could again hand Pharaoh his cup. ", "But Pharaoh impaled the chief baker, just as Joseph had predicted when he interpreted his dream. ", "Pharaoh’s chief cup-bearer, however, forgot all about Joseph, never giving him another thought."]}
