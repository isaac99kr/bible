Play the sweet lyre and the harp.", "Blow the ram’s horn at new moon, and again at full moon to call a festival!", "For this is required by the decrees of Israel; it is a regulation of the God of Jacob.", "He made it a law for Israel when he attacked Egypt to set us free. I heard an unknown voice say,", "“Now I will take the load from your shoulders; I will free your hands from their heavy tasks.", "You cried to me in trouble, and I saved you; I answered out of the thundercloud and tested your faith when there was no water at Meribah. Interlude", "“Listen to me, O my people, while I give you stern warnings. O Israel, if you would only listen to me!", "You must never have a foreign god; you must not bow down before a false god.", "For it was I, the Lord your God, who rescued you from the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it with good things.", "“But no, my people wouldn’t listen. Israel did not want me around.", "So I let them follow their own stubborn desires, living according to their own ideas.", "Oh, that my people would listen to me!
