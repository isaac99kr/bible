If you want, I’ll make three shelters as memorials—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”", "But even as he spoke, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my dearly loved Son, who brings me great joy.

Do kings tax their own people or the people they have conquered?”", "“They tax the people they have conquered,” Peter replied. “Well, then,” Jesus said, “the citizens are free! ", "However, we don’t want to offend them, so go down to the lake and throw in a line. Open the mouth of the first fish you catch, and you will find a large silver coin. Take it and pay the tax for both of us.”"]}
