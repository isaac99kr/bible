", "So they earnestly begged Jesus to help the man. “If anyone deserves your help, he does,” they said, ", "“for he loves the Jewish people and even built a synagogue for us.”", "So Jesus went with them. But just before they arrived at the house, the officer sent some friends to say, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself by coming to my home, for I am not worthy of such an honor. ", "I am not even worthy to come and meet you. Just say the word from where you are, and my servant will be healed. ", "I know this because I am under the authority of my superior officers, and I have authority over my soldiers. I only need to say, ‘Go,’ and they go, or ‘Come,’ and they come. And if I say to my slaves, ‘Do this,’ they do it.”", "When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. Turning to the crowd that was following him, he said, “I tell you, I haven’t seen faith like this in all Israel!” ", "And when the officer’s friends returned to his house, they found the slave completely healed.", "<h>Jesus Raises a Widow’s Son</h>Soon afterward Jesus went with his disciples to the village of Nain, and a large crowd followed him.

Was he a weak reed, swayed by every breath of wind? ", "Or were you expecting to see a man dressed in expensive clothes? No, people who wear beautiful clothes and live in luxury are found in palaces.

", "They are like children playing a game in the public square. They complain to their friends, ‘We played wedding songs, and you didn’t dance, so we played funeral songs, and you didn’t weep.’", "For John the Baptist didn’t spend his time eating bread or drinking wine, and you say, ‘He’s possessed by a demon.’ ", "The Son of Man, on the other hand, feasts and drinks, and you say, ‘He’s a glutton and a drunkard, and a friend of tax collectors and other sinners!’ ", "But wisdom is shown to be right by the lives of those who follow it.”", "<h>Jesus Anointed by a Sinful Woman</h>One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to have dinner with him, so Jesus went to his home and sat down to eat. ", "When a certain immoral woman from that city heard he was eating there, she brought a beautiful alabaster jar filled with expensive perfume. ", "Then she knelt behind him at his feet, weeping. Her tears fell on his feet, and she wiped them off with her hair. Then she kept kissing his feet and putting perfume on them.", "When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know what kind of woman is touching him. She’s a sinner!”", "Then Jesus answered his thoughts. “Simon,” he said to the Pharisee, “I have something to say to you.” “Go ahead, Teacher,” Simon replied.", "Then Jesus told him this story: “A man loaned money to two people—500 pieces of silver to one and 50 pieces to the other.
