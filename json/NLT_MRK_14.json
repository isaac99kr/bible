", "“It could have been sold for a year’s wages and the money given to the poor!” So they scolded her harshly.", "But Jesus replied, “Leave her alone. Why criticize her for doing such a good thing to me? ", "You will always have the poor among you, and you can help them whenever you want to. But you will not always have me.

Yet I want your will to be done, not mine.”", "Then he returned and found the disciples asleep. He said to Peter, “Simon, are you asleep? Couldn’t you watch with me even one hour?

Just then, a rooster crowed.", "When the servant girl saw him standing there, she began telling the others, “This man is definitely one of them!” ", "But Peter denied it again.
