Your miraculous signs are evidence that God is with you.”", "Jesus replied, “I tell you the truth, unless you are born again, you cannot see the Kingdom of God.”", "“What do you mean?” exclaimed Nicodemus. “How can an old man go back into his mother’s womb and be born again?”", "Jesus replied, “I assure you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God without being born of water and the Spirit. ", "Humans can reproduce only human life, but the Holy Spirit gives birth to spiritual life. ", "So don’t be surprised when I say, ‘You must be born again.’ ", "The wind blows wherever it wants. Just as you can hear the wind but can’t tell where it comes from or where it is going, so you can’t explain how people are born of the Spirit.”", "“How are these things possible?” Nicodemus asked.", "Jesus replied, “You are a respected Jewish teacher, and yet you don’t understand these things? ", "I assure you, we tell you what we know and have seen, and yet you won’t believe our testimony.

But anyone who does not believe in him has already been judged for not believing in God’s one and only Son.
