Dan’s territory extends all the way across the land of Israel from east to west.", "“Asher’s territory lies south of Dan’s and also extends from east to west. ", "Naphtali’s land lies south of Asher’s, also extending from east to west. ", "Then comes Manasseh south of Naphtali, and its territory also extends from east to west.

", "For the priests there will be a strip of land measuring 81/3 miles long by 31/3 miles wide, with the Lord’s Temple at the center. ", "This area is set aside for the ordained priests, the descendants of Zadok who served me faithfully and did not go astray with the people of Israel and the rest of the Levites. ", "It will be their special portion when the land is distributed, the most sacred land of all. Next to the priests’ territory will lie the land where the other Levites will live.", "“The land allotted to the Levites will be the same size and shape as that belonging to the priests—81/3 miles long and 31/3 miles wide. Together these portions of land will measure 81/3 miles long by 62/3 miles wide.

", "The city will measure 11/2 miles on each side—north, south, east, and west. ", "Open lands will surround the city for 150 yards in every direction. ", "Outside the city there will be a farming area that stretches 31/3 miles to the east and 31/3 miles to the west along the border of the sacred area. This farmland will produce food for the people working in the city. ", "Those who come from the various tribes to work in the city may farm it. ", "This entire area—including the sacred lands and the city—is a square that measures 81/3 miles on each side.", "“The areas that remain, to the east and to the west of the sacred lands and the city, will belong to the prince. Each of these areas will be 81/3 miles wide, extending in opposite directions to the eastern and western borders of Israel, with the sacred lands and the sanctuary of the Temple in the center. ", "So the prince’s land will include everything between the territories allotted to Judah and Benjamin, except for the areas set aside for the sacred lands and the city.", "“These are the territories allotted to the rest of the tribes. Benjamin’s territory lies just south of the prince’s lands, and it extends across the entire land of Israel from east to west.

I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!", "<h>The Gates of the City</h>“These will be the exits to the city: On the north wall, which is 11/2 miles long, ", "there will be three gates, each one named after a tribe of Israel.
