{"verses": ["Who may worship in your sanctuary, Lord? Who may enter your presence on your holy hill?", "Those who lead blameless lives and do what is right, speaking the truth from sincere hearts.", "Those who refuse to gossip or harm their neighbors or speak evil of their friends.", "Those who despise flagrant sinners, and honor the faithful followers of the Lord, and keep their promises even when it hurts.", "Those who lend money without charging interest, and who cannot be bribed to lie about the innocent. Such people will stand firm forever."]}
