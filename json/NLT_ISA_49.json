I am like a sharp arrow in his quiver.", "He said to me, “You are my servant, Israel, and you will bring me glory.”", "I replied, “But my work seems so useless! I have spent my strength for nothing and to no purpose.

The Lord has honored me, and my God has given me strength.", "He says, “You will do more than restore the people of Israel to me. I will make you a light to the Gentiles, and you will bring my salvation to the ends of the earth.”", "The Lord, the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel, says to the one who is despised and rejected by the nations, to the one who is the servant of rulers: “Kings will stand at attention when you pass by.

For the Lord has comforted his people and will have compassion on them in their suffering.", "Yet Jerusalem says, “The Lord has deserted us; the Lord has forgotten us.”", "“Never! Can a mother forget her nursing child? Can she feel no love for the child she has borne? But even if that were possible, I would not forget you!", "See, I have written your name on the palms of my hands. Always in my mind is a picture of Jerusalem’s walls in ruins.", "Soon your descendants will come back, and all who are trying to destroy you will go away.", "Look around you and see, for all your children will come back to you. As surely as I live,” says the Lord, “they will be like jewels or bridal ornaments for you to display.", "“Even the most desolate parts of your abandoned land will soon be crowded with your people. Your enemies who enslaved you will be far away.", "The generations born in exile will return and say, ‘We need more room! It’s crowded here!’", "Then you will think to yourself, ‘Who has given me all these descendants? For most of my children were killed, and the rest were carried away into exile. I was left here all alone. Where did all these people come from? Who bore these children? Who raised them for me?’”", "This is what the Sovereign Lord says: “See, I will give a signal to the godless nations. They will carry your little sons back to you in their arms; they will bring your daughters on their shoulders.", "Kings and queens will serve you and care for all your needs.

Who can demand that a tyrant let his captives go?", "But the Lord says, “The captives of warriors will be released, and the plunder of tyrants will be retrieved. For I will fight those who fight you, and I will save your children.", "I will feed your enemies with their own flesh. They will be drunk with rivers of their own blood. All the world will know that I, the Lord, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Israel.”"]}
