{"verses": ["Only fools say in their hearts, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, and their actions are evil; not one of them does good!", "The Lord looks down from heaven on the entire human race; he looks to see if anyone is truly wise, if anyone seeks God.", "But no, all have turned away; all have become corrupt. No one does good, not a single one!", "Will those who do evil never learn? They eat up my people like bread and wouldn’t think of praying to the Lord.", "Terror will grip them, for God is with those who obey him.", "The wicked frustrate the plans of the oppressed, but the Lord will protect his people.", "Who will come from Mount Zion to rescue Israel? When the Lord restores his people, Jacob will shout with joy, and Israel will rejoice."]}
