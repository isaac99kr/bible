But you have gone too far, killing them without mercy, and all heaven is disturbed. ", "And now you are planning to make slaves of these people from Judah and Jerusalem. What about your own sins against the Lord your God? ", "Listen to me and return these prisoners you have taken, for they are your own relatives.

Our guilt is already great, and the Lord’s fierce anger is already turned against Israel.”", "So the warriors released the prisoners and handed over the plunder in the sight of the leaders and all the people. ", "Then the four men just mentioned by name came forward and distributed clothes from the plunder to the prisoners who were naked. They provided clothing and sandals to wear, gave them enough food and drink, and dressed their wounds with olive oil.

He shut the doors of the Lord’s Temple so that no one could worship there, and he set up altars to pagan gods in every corner of Jerusalem.
