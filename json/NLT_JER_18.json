{"verses": ["<h>The Potter and the Clay</h>The Lord gave another message to Jeremiah. He said, ", "“Go down to the potter’s shop, and I will speak to you there.” ", "So I did as he told me and found the potter working at his wheel. ", "But the jar he was making did not turn out as he had hoped, so he crushed it into a lump of clay again and started over.", "Then the Lord gave me this message: ", "“O Israel, can I not do to you as this potter has done to his clay? As the clay is in the potter’s hand, so are you in my hand. ", "If I announce that a certain nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down, and destroyed, ", "but then that nation renounces its evil ways, I will not destroy it as I had planned. ", "And if I announce that I will plant and build up a certain nation or kingdom, ", "but then that nation turns to evil and refuses to obey me, I will not bless it as I said I would.", "“Therefore, Jeremiah, go and warn all Judah and Jerusalem. Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord says: I am planning disaster for you instead of good. So turn from your evil ways, each of you, and do what is right.’”", "But the people replied, “Don’t waste your breath. We will continue to live as we want to, stubbornly following our own evil desires.”", "So this is what the Lord says: “Has anyone ever heard of such a thing, even among the pagan nations? My virgin daughter Israel has done something terrible!", "Does the snow ever disappear from the mountaintops of Lebanon? Do the cold streams flowing from those distant mountains ever run dry?", "But my people are not so reliable, for they have deserted me; they burn incense to worthless idols. They have stumbled off the ancient highways and walk in muddy paths.", "Therefore, their land will become desolate, a monument to their stupidity. All who pass by will be astonished and will shake their heads in amazement.", "I will scatter my people before their enemies as the east wind scatters dust. And in all their trouble I will turn my back on them and refuse to notice their distress.”", "<h>A Plot against Jeremiah</h>Then the people said, “Come on, let’s plot a way to stop Jeremiah. We have plenty of priests and wise men and prophets. We don’t need him to teach the word and give us advice and prophecies. Let’s spread rumors about him and ignore what he says.”", "Lord, hear me and help me! Listen to what my enemies are saying.", "Should they repay evil for good? They have dug a pit to kill me, though I pleaded for them and tried to protect them from your anger.", "So let their children starve! Let them die by the sword! Let their wives become childless widows. Let their old men die in a plague, and let their young men be killed in battle!", "Let screaming be heard from their homes as warriors come suddenly upon them. For they have dug a pit for me and have hidden traps along my path.", "Lord, you know all about their murderous plots against me. Don’t forgive their crimes and blot out their sins. Let them die before you. Deal with them in your anger."]}
