The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-haggoyim. ", "Sisera, who had 900 iron chariots, ruthlessly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years. Then the people of Israel cried out to the Lord for help.", "Deborah, the wife of Lappidoth, was a prophet who was judging Israel at that time. ", "She would sit under the Palm of Deborah, between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites would go to her for judgment. ", "One day she sent for Barak son of Abinoam, who lived in Kedesh in the land of Naphtali. She said to him, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, commands you: Call out 10,000 warriors from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun at Mount Tabor. ", "And I will call out Sisera, commander of Jabin’s army, along with his chariots and warriors, to the Kishon River. There I will give you victory over him.”", "Barak told her, “I will go, but only if you go with me.”", "“Very well,” she replied, “I will go with you.

Don’t be afraid.” So he went into her tent, and she covered him with a blanket.", "“Please give me some water,” he said. “I’m thirsty.” So she gave him some milk from a leather bag and covered him again.", "“Stand at the door of the tent,” he told her. “If anybody comes and asks you if there is anyone here, say no.”", "But when Sisera fell asleep from exhaustion, Jael quietly crept up to him with a hammer and tent peg in her hand. Then she drove the tent peg through his temple and into the ground, and so he died.", "When Barak came looking for Sisera, Jael went out to meet him.

", "And from that time on Israel became stronger and stronger against King Jabin until they finally destroyed him."]}
