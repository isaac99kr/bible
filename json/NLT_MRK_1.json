", "All of Judea, including all the people of Jerusalem, went out to see and hear John. And when they confessed their sins, he baptized them in the Jordan River. ", "His clothes were woven from coarse camel hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. For food he ate locusts and wild honey.", "John announced: “Someone is coming soon who is greater than I am—so much greater that I’m not even worthy to stoop down like a slave and untie the straps of his sandals. ", "I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit!”", "<h>The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus</h>One day Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and John baptized him in the Jordan River.

Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”", "But Jesus reprimanded him. “Be quiet! Come out of the man,” he ordered. ", "At that, the evil spirit screamed, threw the man into a convulsion, and then came out of him.", "Amazement gripped the audience, and they began to discuss what had happened. “What sort of new teaching is this?” they asked excitedly. “It has such authority!

", "Then Jesus sent him on his way with a stern warning: ", "“Don’t tell anyone about this. Instead, go to the priest and let him examine you. Take along the offering required in the law of Moses for those who have been healed of leprosy. This will be a public testimony that you have been cleansed.”", "But the man went and spread the word, proclaiming to everyone what had happened. As a result, large crowds soon surrounded Jesus, and he couldn’t publicly enter a town anywhere. He had to stay out in the secluded places, but people from everywhere kept coming to him."]}
