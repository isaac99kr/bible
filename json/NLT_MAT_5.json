And remember, the ancient prophets were persecuted in the same way.", "<h>Teaching about Salt and Light</h>“You are the salt of the earth. But what good is salt if it has lost its flavor?

", "But I say, love your enemies! Pray for those who persecute you! ", "In that way, you will be acting as true children of your Father in heaven.
