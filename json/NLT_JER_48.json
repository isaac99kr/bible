This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: “What sorrow awaits the city of Nebo; it will soon lie in ruins. The city of Kiriathaim will be humiliated and captured; the fortress will be humiliated and broken down.", "No one will ever brag about Moab again, for in Heshbon there is a plot to destroy her. ‘Come,’ they say, ‘we will cut her off from being a nation.’ The town of Madmen, too, will be silenced; the sword will follow you there.", "Listen to the cries from Horonaim, cries of devastation and great destruction.", "All Moab is destroyed.

He is like wine that has been allowed to settle. He has not been poured from flask to flask, and he is now fragrant and smooth.", "But the time is coming soon,” says the Lord, “when I will send men to pour him from his jar. They will pour him out, then shatter the jar!", "At last Moab will be ashamed of his idol Chemosh, as the people of Israel were ashamed of their gold calf at Bethel.", "“You used to boast, ‘We are heroes, mighty men of war.’", "But now Moab and his towns will be destroyed.

We know of his lofty pride, his arrogance, and his haughty heart.", "I know about his insolence,” says the Lord, “but his boasts are empty— as empty as his deeds.", "So now I wail for Moab; yes, I will mourn for Moab. My heart is broken for the men of Kir-hareseth.", "“You people of Sibmah, rich in vineyards, I will weep for you even more than I did for Jazer. Your spreading vines once reached as far as the Dead Sea, but the destroyer has stripped you bare! He has harvested your grapes and summer fruits.", "Joy and gladness are gone from fruitful Moab. The presses yield no wine. No one treads the grapes with shouts of joy. There is shouting, yes, but not of joy.", "“Instead, their awful cries of terror can be heard from Heshbon clear across to Elealeh and Jahaz; from Zoar all the way to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah.

The enemy swoops down like an eagle, spreading his wings over Moab.", "Its cities will fall, and its strongholds will be seized. Even the mightiest warriors will be in anguish like a woman in labor.", "Moab will no longer be a nation, for it has boasted against the Lord.", "“Terror and traps and snares will be your lot, O Moab,” says the Lord.", "“Those who flee in terror will fall into a trap, and those who escape the trap will step into a snare. I will see to it that you do not get away, for the time of your judgment has come,” says the Lord.", "“The people flee as far as Heshbon but are unable to go on.

I, the Lord, have spoken!” This is the end of Jeremiah’s prophecy concerning Moab."]}
