Weep, you oaks of Bashan, for the thick forests have been cut down.", "Listen to the wailing of the shepherds, for their rich pastures are destroyed. Hear the young lions roaring, for their thickets in the Jordan Valley are ruined.", "<h>The Good and Evil Shepherds</h>This is what the Lord my God says: “Go and care for the flock that is intended for slaughter. ", "The buyers slaughter their sheep without remorse. The sellers say, ‘Praise the Lord! Now I’m rich!’ Even the shepherds have no compassion for them. ", "Likewise, I will no longer have pity on the people of the land,” says the Lord. “I will let them fall into each other’s hands and into the hands of their king. They will turn the land into a wilderness, and I will not rescue them.”", "So I cared for the flock intended for slaughter—the flock that was oppressed. Then I took two shepherd’s staffs and named one Favor and the other Union. ", "I got rid of their three evil shepherds in a single month. But I became impatient with these sheep, and they hated me, too. ", "So I told them, “I won’t be your shepherd any longer. If you die, you die. If you are killed, you are killed. And let those who remain devour each other!”", "Then I took my staff called Favor and cut it in two, showing that I had revoked the covenant I had made with all the nations. ", "That was the end of my covenant with them.

", "This illustrates how I will give this nation a shepherd who will not care for those who are dying, nor look after the young, nor heal the injured, nor feed the healthy. Instead, this shepherd will eat the meat of the fattest sheep and tear off their hooves.", "“What sorrow awaits this worthless shepherd who abandons the flock! The sword will cut his arm and pierce his right eye. His arm will become useless, and his right eye completely blind.”"]}
