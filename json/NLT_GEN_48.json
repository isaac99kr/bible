", "He said to me, ‘I will make you fruitful, and I will multiply your descendants. I will make you a multitude of nations. And I will give this land of Canaan to your descendants after you as an everlasting possession.’", "“Now I am claiming as my own sons these two boys of yours, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born here in the land of Egypt before I arrived. They will be my sons, just as Reuben and Simeon are. ", "But any children born to you in the future will be your own, and they will inherit land within the territories of their brothers Ephraim and Manasseh.", "“Long ago, as I was returning from Paddan-aram, Rachel died in the land of Canaan.
