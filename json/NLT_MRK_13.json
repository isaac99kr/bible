But this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come.", "“When these things begin to happen, watch out! You will be handed over to the local councils and beaten in the synagogues. You will stand trial before governors and kings because you are my followers. But this will be your opportunity to tell them about me. ", "For the Good News must first be preached to all nations. ", "But when you are arrested and stand trial, don’t worry in advance about what to say.
