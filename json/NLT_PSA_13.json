{"verses": ["O Lord, how long will you forget me? Forever? How long will you look the other way?", "How long must I struggle with anguish in my soul, with sorrow in my heart every day? How long will my enemy have the upper hand?", "Turn and answer me, O Lord my God! Restore the sparkle to my eyes, or I will die.", "Don’t let my enemies gloat, saying, “We have defeated him!” Don’t let them rejoice at my downfall.", "But I trust in your unfailing love. I will rejoice because you have rescued me.", "I will sing to the Lord because he is good to me."]}
