{"verses": ["<h>Fair Treatment of Slaves</h>“These are the regulations you must present to Israel.", "“If you buy a Hebrew slave, he may serve for no more than six years. Set him free in the seventh year, and he will owe you nothing for his freedom. ", "If he was single when he became your slave, he shall leave single. But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife must be freed with him.", "“If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave and they had sons or daughters, then only the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master. ", "But the slave may declare, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children. I don’t want to go free.’ ", "If he does this, his master must present him before God. Then his master must take him to the door or doorpost and publicly pierce his ear with an awl. After that, the slave will serve his master for life.", "“When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are. ", "If she does not satisfy her owner, he must allow her to be bought back again. But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her. ", "But if the slave’s owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave but as a daughter.", "“If a man who has married a slave wife takes another wife for himself, he must not neglect the rights of the first wife to food, clothing, and sexual intimacy. ", "If he fails in any of these three obligations, she may leave as a free woman without making any payment.", "<h>Cases of Personal Injury</h>“Anyone who assaults and kills another person must be put to death.

", "If he is later able to walk outside again, even with a crutch, the assailant will not be punished but must compensate his victim for lost wages and provide for his full recovery.", "“If a man beats his male or female slave with a club and the slave dies as a result, the owner must be punished. ", "But if the slave recovers within a day or two, then the owner shall not be punished, since the slave is his property.", "“Now suppose two men are fighting, and in the process they accidentally strike a pregnant woman so she gives birth prematurely. If no further injury results, the man who struck the woman must pay the amount of compensation the woman’s husband demands and the judges approve. ", "But if there is further injury, the punishment must match the injury: a life for a life, ", "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot, ", "a burn for a burn, a wound for a wound, a bruise for a bruise.", "“If a man hits his male or female slave in the eye and the eye is blinded, he must let the slave go free to compensate for the eye.

In such a case, however, the owner will not be held liable. ", "But suppose the ox had a reputation for goring, and the owner had been informed but failed to keep it under control. If the ox then kills someone, it must be stoned, and the owner must also be put to death. ", "However, the dead person’s relatives may accept payment to compensate for the loss of life. The owner of the ox may redeem his life by paying whatever is demanded.", "“The same regulation applies if the ox gores a boy or a girl. ", "But if the ox gores a slave, either male or female, the animal’s owner must pay the slave’s owner thirty silver coins, and the ox must be stoned.", "“Suppose someone digs or uncovers a pit and fails to cover it, and then an ox or a donkey falls into it. ", "The owner of the pit must pay full compensation to the owner of the animal, but then he gets to keep the dead animal.", "“If someone’s ox injures a neighbor’s ox and the injured ox dies, then the two owners must sell the live ox and divide the price equally between them. They must also divide the dead animal. ", "But if the ox had a reputation for goring, yet its owner failed to keep it under control, he must pay full compensation—a live ox for the dead one—but he may keep the dead ox."]}
