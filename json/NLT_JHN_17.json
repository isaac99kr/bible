Holy Father, you have given me your name; now protect them by the power of your name so that they will be united just as we are. ", "During my time here, I protected them by the power of the name you gave me. I guarded them so that not one was lost, except the one headed for destruction, as the Scriptures foretold.", "“Now I am coming to you. I told them many things while I was with them in this world so they would be filled with my joy. ", "I have given them your word.

", "I pray that they will all be one, just as you and I are one—as you are in me, Father, and I am in you. And may they be in us so that the world will believe you sent me.", "“I have given them the glory you gave me, so they may be one as we are one. ", "I am in them and you are in me. May they experience such perfect unity that the world will know that you sent me and that you love them as much as you love me. ", "Father, I want these whom you have given me to be with me where I am. Then they can see all the glory you gave me because you loved me even before the world began!", "“O righteous Father, the world doesn’t know you, but I do; and these disciples know you sent me. ", "I have revealed you to them, and I will continue to do so. Then your love for me will be in them, and I will be in them.”"]}
