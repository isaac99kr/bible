The Temple was built on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, the site that David had selected. ", "The construction began in midspring, during the fourth year of Solomonâ€™s reign.", "These are the dimensions Solomon used for the foundation of the Temple of God (using the old standard of measurement). It was 90 feet long and 30 feet wide. ", "The entry room at the front of the Temple was 30 feet wide, running across the entire width of the Temple, and 30 feet high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold.", "He paneled the main room of the Temple with cypress wood, overlaid it with fine gold, and decorated it with carvings of palm trees and chains. ", "He decorated the walls of the Temple with beautiful jewels and with gold from the land of Parvaim. ", "He overlaid the beams, thresholds, walls, and doors throughout the Temple with gold, and he carved figures of cherubim on the walls.", "He made the Most Holy Place 30 feet wide, corresponding to the width of the Temple, and 30 feet deep. He overlaid its interior with 23 tons of fine gold. ", "The gold nails that were used weighed 20 ounces each. He also overlaid the walls of the upper rooms with gold.", "He made two figures shaped like cherubim, overlaid them with gold, and placed them in the Most Holy Place.
