{"verses": ["<h>Jerusalem—a Useless Vine</h>Then this message came to me from the Lord: ", "“Son of man, how does a grapevine compare to a tree? Is a vine’s wood as useful as the wood of a tree? ", "Can its wood be used for making things, like pegs to hang up pots and pans? ", "No, it can only be used for fuel, and even as fuel, it burns too quickly. ", "Vines are useless both before and after being put into the fire!", "“And this is what the Sovereign Lord says: The people of Jerusalem are like grapevines growing among the trees of the forest. Since they are useless, I have thrown them on the fire to be burned. ", "And I will see to it that if they escape from one fire, they will fall into another. When I turn against them, you will know that I am the Lord. ", "And I will make the land desolate because my people have been unfaithful to me. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!”"]}
