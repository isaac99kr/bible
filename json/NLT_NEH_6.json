{"verses": ["<h>Continued Opposition to Rebuilding</h>Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies found out that I had finished rebuilding the wall and that no gaps remained—though we had not yet set up the doors in the gates. ", "So Sanballat and Geshem sent a message asking me to meet them at one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But I realized they were plotting to harm me, ", "so I replied by sending this message to them: “I am engaged in a great work, so I can’t come. Why should I stop working to come and meet with you?”", "Four times they sent the same message, and each time I gave the same reply. ", "The fifth time, Sanballat’s servant came with an open letter in his hand, ", "and this is what it said: “There is a rumor among the surrounding nations, and Geshem tells me it is true, that you and the Jews are planning to rebel and that is why you are building the wall. According to his reports, you plan to be their king. ", "He also reports that you have appointed prophets in Jerusalem to proclaim about you, ‘Look! There is a king in Judah!’ “You can be very sure that this report will get back to the king, so I suggest that you come and talk it over with me.”", "I replied, “There is no truth in any part of your story. You are making up the whole thing.”", "They were just trying to intimidate us, imagining that they could discourage us and stop the work. So I continued the work with even greater determination.", "Later I went to visit Shemaiah son of Delaiah and grandson of Mehetabel, who was confined to his home. He said, “Let us meet together inside the Temple of God and bolt the doors shut. Your enemies are coming to kill you tonight.”", "But I replied, “Should someone in my position run from danger? Should someone in my position enter the Temple to save his life? No, I won’t do it!” ", "I realized that God had not spoken to him, but that he had uttered this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.

They realized this work had been done with the help of our God.", "During those fifty-two days, many letters went back and forth between Tobiah and the nobles of Judah.
