At noon and again at three o’clock he did the same thing.", "“At five o’clock that afternoon he was in town again and saw some more people standing around. He asked them, ‘Why haven’t you been working today?’", "“They replied, ‘Because no one hired us.’ “The landowner told them, ‘Then go out and join the others in my vineyard.’", "“That evening he told the foreman to call the workers in and pay them, beginning with the last workers first.
