The foundations of the heavens shook; they quaked because of his anger.", "Smoke poured from his nostrils; fierce flames leaped from his mouth. Glowing coals blazed forth from him.", "He opened the heavens and came down; dark storm clouds were beneath his feet.", "Mounted on a mighty angelic being, he flew, soaring on the wings of the wind.", "He shrouded himself in darkness, veiling his approach with dense rain clouds.", "A great brightness shone around him, and burning coals blazed forth.", "The Lord thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded.", "He shot arrows and scattered his enemies; his lightning flashed, and they were confused.", "Then at the command of the Lord, at the blast of his breath, the bottom of the sea could be seen, and the foundations of the earth were laid bare.", "“He reached down from heaven and rescued me; he drew me out of deep waters.", "He rescued me from my powerful enemies, from those who hated me and were too strong for me.", "They attacked me at a moment when I was in distress, but the Lord supported me.", "He led me to a place of safety; he rescued me because he delights in me.", "The Lord rewarded me for doing right; he restored me because of my innocence.", "For I have kept the ways of the Lord; I have not turned from my God to follow evil.", "I have followed all his regulations; I have never abandoned his decrees.", "I am blameless before God; I have kept myself from sin.", "The Lord rewarded me for doing right.

Praise to my Rock! May God, the Rock of my salvation, be exalted!", "He is the God who pays back those who harm me; he brings down the nations under me", "and delivers me from my enemies. You hold me safe beyond the reach of my enemies; you save me from violent opponents.", "For this, O Lord, I will praise you among the nations; I will sing praises to your name.", "You give great victories to your king; you show unfailing love to your anointed, to David and all his descendants forever.”"]}
