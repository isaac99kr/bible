", "Heal the sick, and tell them, ‘The Kingdom of God is near you now.’ ", "But if a town refuses to welcome you, go out into its streets and say, ", "‘We wipe even the dust of your town from our feet to show that we have abandoned you to your fate. And know this—the Kingdom of God is near!’ ", "I assure you, even wicked Sodom will be better off than such a town on judgment day.", "“What sorrow awaits you, Korazin and Bethsaida!
