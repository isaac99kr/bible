Today I have become your Father.”", "And in another passage God said to him, “You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”", "While Jesus was here on earth, he offered prayers and pleadings, with a loud cry and tears, to the one who could rescue him from death. And God heard his prayers because of his deep reverence for God. ", "Even though Jesus was God’s Son, he learned obedience from the things he suffered.
