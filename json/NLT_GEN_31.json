Let them judge between us!", "“For twenty years I have been with you, caring for your flocks. In all that time your sheep and goats never miscarried. In all those years I never used a single ram of yours for food. ", "If any were attacked and killed by wild animals, I never showed you the carcass and asked you to reduce the count of your flock.
