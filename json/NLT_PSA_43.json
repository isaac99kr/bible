Why must I wander around in grief, oppressed by my enemies?", "Send out your light and your truth; let them guide me. Let them lead me to your holy mountain, to the place where you live.", "There I will go to the altar of God, to God—the source of all my joy. I will praise you with my harp, O God, my God!", "Why am I discouraged? Why is my heart so sad? I will put my hope in God! I will praise him again— my Savior and my God!"]}
