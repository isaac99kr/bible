", "This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies says: Look at what’s happening to you! ", "You have planted much but harvest little. You eat but are not satisfied. You drink but are still thirsty. You put on clothes but cannot keep warm. Your wages disappear as though you were putting them in pockets filled with holes!", "“This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies says: Look at what’s happening to you! ", "Now go up into the hills, bring down timber, and rebuild my house. Then I will take pleasure in it and be honored, says the Lord. ", "You hoped for rich harvests, but they were poor. And when you brought your harvest home, I blew it away. Why? Because my house lies in ruins, says the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, while all of you are busy building your own fine houses. ", "It’s because of you that the heavens withhold the dew and the earth produces no crops.
