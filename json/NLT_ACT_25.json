", "They asked Festus as a favor to transfer Paul to Jerusalem (planning to ambush and kill him on the way). ", "But Festus replied that Paul was at Caesarea and he himself would be returning there soon. ", "So he said, “Those of you in authority can return with me. If Paul has done anything wrong, you can make your accusations.”", "About eight or ten days later Festus returned to Caesarea, and on the following day he took his seat in court and ordered that Paul be brought in. ", "When Paul arrived, the Jewish leaders from Jerusalem gathered around and made many serious accusations they couldn’t prove.", "Paul denied the charges. “I am not guilty of any crime against the Jewish laws or the Temple or the Roman government,” he said.", "Then Festus, wanting to please the Jews, asked him, “Are you willing to go to Jerusalem and stand trial before me there?”", "But Paul replied, “No! This is the official Roman court, so I ought to be tried right here. You know very well I am not guilty of harming the Jews. ", "If I have done something worthy of death, I don’t refuse to die. But if I am innocent, no one has a right to turn me over to these men to kill me. I appeal to Caesar!”", "Festus conferred with his advisers and then replied, “Very well! You have appealed to Caesar, and to Caesar you will go!”", "A few days later King Agrippa arrived with his sister, Bernice, to pay their respects to Festus.

I called the case the very next day and ordered Paul brought in. ", "But the accusations made against him weren’t any of the crimes I expected.

Festus ordered that Paul be brought in. ", "Then Festus said, “King Agrippa and all who are here, this is the man whose death is demanded by all the Jews, both here and in Jerusalem. ", "But in my opinion he has done nothing deserving death. However, since he appealed his case to the emperor, I have decided to send him to Rome.", "“But what shall I write the emperor? For there is no clear charge against him. So I have brought him before all of you, and especially you, King Agrippa, so that after we examine him, I might have something to write. ", "For it makes no sense to send a prisoner to the emperor without specifying the charges against him!”"]}
