They give a push to people who are stumbling.", "But robbers are left in peace, and those who provoke God live in safety— though God keeps them in his power.", "“Just ask the animals, and they will teach you. Ask the birds of the sky, and they will tell you.", "Speak to the earth, and it will instruct you.
