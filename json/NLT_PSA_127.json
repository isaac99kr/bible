{"verses": ["Unless the Lord builds a house, the work of the builders is wasted. Unless the Lord protects a city, guarding it with sentries will do no good.", "It is useless for you to work so hard from early morning until late at night, anxiously working for food to eat; for God gives rest to his loved ones.", "Children are a gift from the Lord; they are a reward from him.", "Children born to a young man are like arrows in a warriorâ€™s hands.", "How joyful is the man whose quiver is full of them! He will not be put to shame when he confronts his accusers at the city gates."]}
