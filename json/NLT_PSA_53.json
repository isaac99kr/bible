No one does good, not a single one!", "Will those who do evil never learn? They eat up my people like bread and wouldn’t think of praying to God.", "Terror will grip them, terror like they have never known before. God will scatter the bones of your enemies. You will put them to shame, for God has rejected them.", "Who will come from Mount Zion to rescue Israel? When God restores his people, Jacob will shout with joy, and Israel will rejoice."]}
