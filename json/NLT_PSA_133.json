{"verses": ["How wonderful and pleasant it is when brothers live together in harmony!", "For harmony is as precious as the anointing oil that was poured over Aaronâ€™s head, that ran down his beard and onto the border of his robe.", "Harmony is as refreshing as the dew from Mount Hermon that falls on the mountains of Zion. And there the Lord has pronounced his blessing, even life everlasting."]}
