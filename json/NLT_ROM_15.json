You know these things so well you can teach each other all about them. ", "Even so, I have been bold enough to write about some of these points, knowing that all you need is this reminder.

", "Then, by the will of God, I will be able to come to you with a joyful heart, and we will be an encouragement to each other.", "And now may God, who gives us his peace, be with you all. Amen."]}
