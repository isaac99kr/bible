He is the finest man in all the earth. He is blameless—a man of complete integrity. He fears God and stays away from evil. And he has maintained his integrity, even though you urged me to harm him without cause.”", "Satan replied to the Lord, “Skin for skin! A man will give up everything he has to save his life. ", "But reach out and take away his health, and he will surely curse you to your face!”", "“All right, do with him as you please,” the Lord said to Satan. “But spare his life.” ", "So Satan left the Lord’s presence, and he struck Job with terrible boils from head to foot.", "Job scraped his skin with a piece of broken pottery as he sat among the ashes. ", "His wife said to him, “Are you still trying to maintain your integrity? Curse God and die.”", "But Job replied, “You talk like a foolish woman.

No one said a word to Job, for they saw that his suffering was too great for words."]}
