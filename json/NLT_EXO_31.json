The craftsmen must make everything as I have commanded you.”", "<h>Instructions for the Sabbath</h>The Lord then gave these instructions to Moses: ", "“Tell the people of Israel: ‘Be careful to keep my Sabbath day, for the Sabbath is a sign of the covenant between me and you from generation to generation. It is given so you may know that I am the Lord, who makes you holy. ", "You must keep the Sabbath day, for it is a holy day for you. Anyone who desecrates it must be put to death; anyone who works on that day will be cut off from the community.

Anyone who works on the Sabbath must be put to death. ", "The people of Israel must keep the Sabbath day by observing it from generation to generation. This is a covenant obligation for all time.
